# Annual Plant Model

This code intends to reproduce the results of Yenni et al. (2012).

Yenni, Glenda Marie, Peter Adler, and S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2012. "Strong self-limitation promotes the persistence of rare species." Ecology. 93 (3) pp. 456 â€“ 461. [DOI](http://doi.org/10.1890/11-1087.1)

## Development Environment

We use jupyter notebooks to document results and for the sake of reproducibility. We provide a requirements.txt file in case you want to have the same development environment we have. We use Python >= 3.6.

For creating a virtual environment, you can use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## Required Packages

For the utilized packages, see the [requirements](https://github.com/Tungdil01/Annual_Plant_Model/blob/main/requirements.txt).
